## Rule

A Rule (or Game Rule) is a catch-all term for small scripts. Each Rule should be
written similarly to gameplay instructons for a tabletop game, with one Rule
describing how the players move, one Rule describing how players win, etc.

For example, the "VictoryCondition" Rule might check to see when the player
reaches the exit of a dungeon, and plays a splashy win screen when they do.

- `Rule.js` provides the base code for all Rule types.
